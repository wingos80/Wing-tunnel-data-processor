Currently makes an image from a csv file made up of single float value for each value square. The path to the csv file will need to be changed according to where you've put your file on your machine.

TO DO:
-make the thermal csv processor graph a chordwise temperature distribution, so that we can see the boundary layer behaviours more easily.
-make a .txt processor to process corr_test, cp_test, press_text.
